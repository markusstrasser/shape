        <div class=tldr>
            The Shape Foundation is launching a fellowship to support exceptional upcoming engineers,
            researchers and founders in the biological and computer sciences.
        </div>

        <br/>
        <p>
            The upcoming inaugural cohort of fellows will be <b>invited to San Francisco for a full 2+ week program </b> of get
            togethers, lab tours, journal clubs, group dinners, hikes, daytrips and meetups with leading deep tech
            researchers, engineers and founders. In short: phenomenal vibes.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The exact dates and duration are still TBA but will likely be either before or after the 2022 summer break
            so as to not clash with the usual dates for summer internships.

        </p>
        <p>
            Flights, chic housing close to Golden Gate park 🌴 and a stipend to cover San Francisco expenses will be fully
            covered. After vibeweek(s), we plan to continue supporting fellows financially on a project to project basis. 
            
            Other than that we'll continue hosting IRL events and retreats in or close to hubs.
    
            </p>
            <p>
                In spirit, the fellowship is similar to the <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures"> Emergent Ventures fellowship</a> and the <a href="https://newscience.org/summer-fellowship/"> NewScience summer program</a> but with a decided focus
                on open source infrastructure, simulations and research software.

                WHAT IS THE APPLICATION PROCESS? 
            </span>
            <div class="card_t">
                We usually do two short video calls and one longer technical and playful
                video call to see if a potential fellow might be a fit.

            MOTIVATION
        </span>
        <div class=carda>
            We created the Shape fellowship because many <b>potentially valuable research applications and
             tools are malnurished. </b> The academic incentives to maintain, host and make research software work for more than N=1 users don't exist. 
             Most projects by themselves are not venture fundable and even if they were, creators most often don't want to create a company or GTM strategy around them.
             <!-- There are countless ingenious PhD projects that perished because there's missing a few lines of devOps or a small API refactor. -->
             <p>

            We've seen this over and over again: novel and potentially crucial building blocks for future scientific advances are neglected.
            There's a large spread of (<i>mostly very old</i>) tools that everything relies on for basic tasks (<i>ie. sequence alignment</i>) and which are very hard to run and use. 
            Half of bioinformatics is installing software tools correctly and the rest is just converting between file formats ... as the joke goes. 
            All of this makes the <b>barrier to entry and experimentation prohibitively high</b>. 
            </p>

        <div class=carda>
            We do two 30 minute video calls and one technical/brainstorming
            call to see if a potential fellow is a fit.
            There's currently no application form to fill out. You're here because of a referral or because we contacted you directly.
