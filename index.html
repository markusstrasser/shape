    <h1>The Shape Fellowship</h1>
    <p>
        The Shape Fellowship is currently an invite-only constellation of highly ambitious and talented engineers and researchers in biological and computer sciences.
    </p>
    <p>
        The initial cohort of fellows will be flown out to San Francisco for a full program of get-togethers, dinners, lab tours, hikes, daytrips and general vibing with deep tech researchers, engineers and founders. Basically, a week of vibes. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We plan to have recurring IRL retreats and events in capitals around the world, depending on the distribution of fellows.

    </p>

    <p>
        The exact dates and durations are still TBA but will likely be either before or after the 2022 summer break so as to not clash with the usual dates for summer internships. 

    </p>

    <p>
        Flights, chic housing close to Golden Gate park and a stipend to cover San Francisco expenses will be fully covered. After vibeweek(s), we can support fellows additionally for personal projects, open source contributions or in some cases company formation.

    </p>
    <p>
        How does the application work? We usually do two short video calls and one longer technical and playful video call to see if a potential fellow might be a fit.


    </p>
    <p>
        Who’s funding this? So far we have $1M in contributions from founders, VCs and philanthropists, predominantly from the Bay Area and NYC.


    </p>
    <p>
        The Shape fellowship is in spirit similar to the Emergent Ventures fellowship or NewScience but with a focus on open source software infrastructure and productionizing research into openly usable applications.
